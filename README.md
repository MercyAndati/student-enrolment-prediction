# student-enrolment-prediction
The goal of this model is to predict which students are likely to enrol in a specific program and identify those who may need extra support to successfully graduate. 
By doing this, educational institutions can make data-driven decisions and proactively assist students who might be at risk of dropping out.
Student Enrolment Prediction Model

Data Used

This model is based on three main categories of data:

1.	Historical Student Enrolment Data: This includes past records of student enrolments, withdrawals, and completions.
2.	Student Academic Records: Performance indicators like GPA, credits earned, and class attendance.
3.	Student Demographic Data: Information such as age, nationality, parental education level, financial aid status, and other socioeconomic factors.

1) Which type of machine learning algorithm is most suitable for this task?
For this task, I have chosen the Gradient Boosting Classifier as the most suitable machine learning algorithm.

•	Reasoning: Gradient Boosting is a robust and flexible classification method that constructs an ensemble of decision trees to iteratively enhance prediction accuracy. It excels in handling both numerical and categorical data and performs well on complex datasets like student records.

•	Benefits:

o	It provides feature importance metrics, helping educational institutions understand the key factors affecting student success.

o	It captures nonlinear relationships and interactions between features.

o	It requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and can be adjusted for better interpretability.

2)Relevant Features for Predicting Enrolment and Graduation Success

The key factors influencing the likelihood of student enrolment and graduation success include:

•	Academic Performance: Early academic achievements, including grades, credits earned, and performance in initial semesters.

•	Financial Status: Financial aid or scholarship eligibility, and tuition payment history, since financial stability plays a crucial role in retention.

•	Demographic Information: Factors such as age, nationality, and parental education level, which can influence motivation, support systems, and overall challenges.

•	Socioeconomic Conditions: Broader factors like economic indicators (e.g., unemployment or inflation rates), which can affect students’ ability to manage both work and academic responsibilities.

These features help predict which students may need additional academic or financial support, allowing institutions to design more personalized intervention strategies.

3)Protecting the Privacy of Student Data

•	Data Anonymization: All personally identifiable information is removed or anonymized to prevent any identification of individual students.

•	Data Minimization: Only the essential data needed for the model is used, reducing exposure to sensitive information.

•	Differential Privacy: Adding noise to the data ensures that individual student data remains secure and cannot be reverse-engineered.

•	Access Controls: Data is securely stored, with strict access restrictions in place to comply with privacy laws such as FERPA and GDPR.

Recommendation: Institutions should ensure that data storage and processing comply with relevant legal and institutional privacy standards to maintain confidentiality.

4)How can you communicate the results of your model to educational institution in a way that is actionable and informative? 

To make the model’s insights actionable, I would use the following communication methods:

•	Actionable Insights & Suggested Interventions:

o	I leverage insights from feature importance to guide targeted intervention strategies. For example, if I find that financial aid is a key factor in student success, I recommend that institutions proactively increase financial support for students who are at risk of dropping out.

o	Additionally, I suggest offering academic counseling or mentorship programs for students who show early signs of academic difficulty. This timely support can help them stay on track and succeed in their studies.

o	I also advocate for the development of programs that focus on parental engagement and community support, particularly for students from backgrounds with lower graduation rates. Addressing these external factors can significantly impact their success.

•	Sample Predictions for Transparency:

To enhance transparency in decision-making, I provide anonymized student profiles along with the model’s predictions. This helps institutions understand how different factors influence outcomes and fosters a clearer picture of the data.

•	Continuous Model Improvement:

I emphasize the importance of continuously assessing the model to ensure its suitability for the changing population of students and the economic characteristics of the market. By tracking the outcomes of students flagged by the model, institutions can refine their support programs and improve the model's accuracy over time.

•	Clear Visualizations: I utilize clear visualizations to convey complex information effectively:

o	Feature Importance Chart: This chart shows which features have the most significant impact on student outcomes, guiding institutions on areas to focus on, such as academic or financial support.
	 
o	Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve: These tools help assess model accuracy and performance, allowing institutions to evaluate the reliability of the predictions.
	  
o	Probability Distribution Chart: This visualization categorizes students into risk levels based on their predicted likelihood of success or dropout, making it easier for institutions to identify those in need of support. 

  #i have generated this visualization charts in the code subbmitted, after the model generation.
